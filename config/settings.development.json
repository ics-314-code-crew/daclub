To enhance and enable student opportunities to work in the public sector of environmental law ELS students raise funds for the summer grant program No Ke Ola O Ka `Aina (For the Life of the Land).\nELS members actively raise and promote awareness for greener living through ELS sponsored activities and by “living green” themselves. Living green does not necessarily entail radical sacrifices but those seemingly small changes that can have a big impact in the future. Some of those changes include: recycling using re-usable coffee mugs and take-out containers taking re-usable shopping bags to the grocery store and turning off lights when not in a room be it at home or at school.\nOther ELS activities include participating in the City and County of Honolulu's Adopt-a-Stream program. In addition ELS sponsors island-wide hiking trips and beach cleanups presents papers at and participates in regional and national environmental conferences and organizes service trips to the uninhabited island of Kaho'olawe to assist in cleanup and re-vegetation efforts on the former U.S. military bombing target.\nELS welcomes all those who are interested in environmental law or even those who just love the outdoors and want to keep Hawai'i beautiful so that we can continue to say “lucky we live Hawai'i.\"\n",

By learning from other martial artists it will not only help improve your overall knowledge but will also hopefully bring about a better understanding of the reasons you do things a certain way or bring to light why there might be a flaw in your technique.
